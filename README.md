# Speed-Controlled-Object-Following-Robot-using-pixycam
It's an object following robot repository. Our main objectives are here to build an OFR. If the object moves faster, the robot will also move faster and vice versa to track down the object. We have used pixy camera for detecting the object and overall, the project is based on Arduino.
