## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Speed-Controlled Object Following Robot using PixyCam. This project aims to create a robot that can autonomously follow objects based on color tracking using PixyCam. The robot adjusts its speed and direction to keep the tracked object within its field of view.

## Features
Object tracking based on color recognition using PixyCam.
Speed control for the robot to maintain a constant distance from the tracked object.
Real-time feedback and control via a user-friendly interface.
Easily customizable for different tracking scenarios.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
1. PixyCam with the necessary firmware installed.
2. Robot hardware compatible with the code provided.
3. Arduino IDE for uploading code to the robot's microcontroller.
   
## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Speed-Controlled-Object-Following-Robot.git
Open the Arduino sketch provided in the Arduino directory using the Arduino IDE. Configure the Arduino IDE with the appropriate board and port settings. Upload the sketch to your robot's microcontroller.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the Object Following Robot:

1. Connect your robot hardware to a power source and ensure the PixyCam is properly mounted.

2. Power on the robot and PixyCam.

3. Launch the control software on your computer (if applicable) and establish a connection with the robot.

4. Place an object with the specified color in front of the PixyCam.

5. The robot should now start following the object based on color tracking.

6. Use the control interface to adjust speed and other parameters as needed.

For more detailed usage instructions and customization options, refer to the documentation.
